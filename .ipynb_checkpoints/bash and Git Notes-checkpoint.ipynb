    "## BASH and ZSH CLI Cheat Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical bar**: The vertical bar | represents a pipe in Linux/UNIX systems. It is a form of redirection that sends the output of one program to the input of another program. So for example, `cat file1 | wc` means that the command `cat` will read the contents of `file1` and the send the output as input to the `wc` command. So anytime there is a vertical bar means that there is are multiple commands forming a chain, almost like currying in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single dot**: A single dot, aka a period, in a path refers to the current directory. Double dots refer to the parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**cat**: The `cat` command refers to concatenation and is used for viewing text files in the terminal itself. Example usages below:\n",
    "\n",
    " `cat file1 file2`: Shows contents of file1 and file2 in order. Multiple files can viewed this way.\n",
    " `cat -n file1`: Shows contents of file1 but also labels each line number so you know which line number a certain piece of text appeared.\n",
    " `cat > newfile`: Creates a new file named 'newfile'. When doing this, the shell will expect you to enter some initial text to fill the file. You can simply exit early to not enter anything.\n",
    " `cat file1 > file2`: Copies file1 to file2. file2 is overwritten if it exists, or created if it doesn't.\n",
    " `cat file1 file2 file3 > file4`: Copies file1, file2, file3 to file4 in order or creates a new file called file4 with the copied contents.  \n",
    " `cat file1 >> file2`: Appends file1 to file2.\n",
    " `cat >> file1`: Will append anything typed in the terminal to file1.\n",
    " `cat < file2`: Provides file2 as an input to the `cat` command which will just read out file2.\n",
    " `cat file1 | more`: Shows as much content from file1 in the terminal as possible and if it doesn't fit, will ask user to if they want to see more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**source**: The `source` command in BASH means to run a file in the current SHELL instance instead of starting a new shell. So `source filename` will run the file in the current shell. A short hand for this command is `. filename`. Notice the space between the period and the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "**touch**: The `touch` command is used to create files and change the timestamps/access times of files. So `touch filename1 filename2` creates 2 **empty** files. `touch -c filename` is used to check if a file is created; if it is not, don't create it, just check. \n",
    "\n",
    "**./**: This command is similar to the `source` command but will run the file in a new shell instance. So `./filename` runs the file in a new shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**> or <**: This isn't so much a command but a redirection operator. It controls the input and output of commands. So if I have a command called `foo` then `foo < filename` will provide the `filename` as the input to the `foo` command. Similarly, `foo > filename.txt` will redirect the output to be put into a text file called `filename.txt`. Using `foo >> filename.txt` will append the output of `foo` to `filename.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**>>**: As stated above, this redirects the output of a command to a file and appends the output to the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**which**: Used to identify the location of an a given executable that is executed when you type the name of the executable into the shell. So `which python` shows the location of the executable used to run the Python interpreter. So any scripts, programs, executables that are put into the `PATH` variable can have their location found by using `which`. You can list the location of more than one executable at a time: `which executable1 executable2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**echo**: Used to display a string or whatever output of another command to the terminal. So `echo \"Hello\"` will literally display `Hello` in the terminal. You can use this in conjunction with other commands that return a string output. `echo` is mainly used in bash scripts to display info to the terminal. You can also list out specific files such as `echo *.txt`, which will display all .txt files. You can also display the PATH variable using `echo $PATH`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**printenv**: Used to display the current environment and shell variables used by the current shell. Whenever a shell program starts up it gathers a bunch of information that the shell program (as well its child processes) needs in order to run. The info is stored in a data structure called the environment. Environment variables are the info stored within this data structure that are defined for the current shell and inherited by any child shells or processes. Shell variables are data that is stored exclusively within the shell that created them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**pwd**: Command that prints the full path of the current working directory to the stdout of the shell. Appending `-P` as an option to the `pwd` command prints the full canonical path of the working directory. If the `-L` option is used then it prints the 'logical' path which is the path that includes any soft/symlinks. This means that the `-L` option will only display up to the first symlink?\n",
    "\n",
    "**cp**: Copy command. Command structure is `cp [option] source destination`. So `cp remote.sh /local/bin` will copy the file `remote.sh` in the current directory to the `/local/bin` directory. `destination` can also be another file so then `cp` will overwrite the `destination` file with the `source` file. If the `destination` file doesn't exist, then a new file will be created with that filename.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**~**: Known as a tilde expansion. This has several uses depending on the context and it is dependent on which shell you are running. All characters following the tilde up to the first unquoted slash are considered a 'tilde-prefix'. This 'tilde-prefix' will have different interpretations. The below apply to the bash shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When used by itself in a path such as `~/` then this refers to the `$HOME` environment variable of the current user running the shell. So `~/foo` will be the path to the `foo` directory located in the current user's home directory.\n",
    "- When followed by unquoted characters, then the shell interprets this as a login or username. So `~foo/` will be the path to the home directory of user `foo`. \n",
    "- `~+/` refers to the current working directory. It is equivalent to the output of `$PWD`. \n",
    "- `~-/` refers to the old working directory. It is equivalent to the output of `$OLDPWD`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$HOME**: Current user's home directory. On Windows it defaults to `C:\\\\Users\\\\currentusername`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$PATH**: Current path variable for running executables. For the cmder terminal, you can put any executables into the `cmder/bin` directory to have it load into the initial `$PATH` variable that gets created when the shell starts up. \n",
    "\n",
    "**$PWD**: Stands for \"print working directory\". This shell environment variable contains the path of the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$OLDPWD**: Stands for \"Old print working directory\". This shell environment variable contains the last directory before the last the `cd` command was executed. So if I am in directory `~/foo` and I `cd` to `~/foo/bar` then `$PWD` will contain `~/foo` as it was the directory prior to the last `cd` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "**hash**: This command allows viewing, modifying, and resetting the hash table. The command `hash -r` will empty and remove all entries in the hash table. \n",
    "\n",
    "**rm**: The obvious remove/delete command for files and directories."

    "## GIT COMMAND SHEET\n",
    "\n",
    "`git remote -v`: View the remote origin associated with the current repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git branch`: View all branches on the local repository. `-a` to view all branches including remote tracking branches. `-r` to view remote only. `-v` to view the branches + the SHA-1 hash + commit message. `-vv` to view the branches + SHA-1 + commit message + the remote tracking branch that the local branch is linked to. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git show HEAD`: Shows the commit that the HEAD pointer is currently pointing to.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git show-ref`: Show the refs available on the local repository along with the commit IDs. By default it shows the tags, heads, and remote refs.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add *.ext`: This will add all files with the appropriate extension to the staging area. So `git add *.txt` will add all `.txt` files to the staging area. You can also call `git add subdir` which will update the git index to match the current state of the subdir. So any files modified, added, deleted from the subdir will be recorded in the git index. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`: View the git commit history as a graph with the locations of the local and remote branch refs. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git ls-tree <tree-ish>`: View information about the files being tracked in the tree-ish rev. So `git ls-tree main` will view the files located at the root level of the commit that is being pointed to by main branch ref. If you want to view all files, then you call use `git ls-tree -r main` to recursively look into the subtrees to get all the files. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git reflog`: A log of all the times a ref in the git commit history is updated. So it shows all the activities of the git refs and the commits they were associated with. So making a commit will update the ref of the current branch which will then be recorded in the reflog.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone <git-url> <dir>`: This command allows you to copy everything from the remote repository to your computer. This will create a new folder in `<dir>` whose name will be the same as the name of the repository you are copying. You cannot clone into an existing directory if it is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git push <repo> [<refspec>]`: Command to update the remote refs using local refs and sending over any necessary objects to complete the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git fetch [<refspec>]`: Update the local repo with the refs from the remote repo along with any objects needed to complete the ref/commit histories. So this command will download files and objects and blobs to update your local repo with the information contained in the remote repo. Remote tracking branches are also updated. Look online for specific options to use with this command. This command will only update the refs and objects needed but will not merge the commits with the commits in the local repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you cannot update the current branch ref that the HEAD pointer is pointing to with `git fetch`. So if you are on the main branch, and you run `git fetch origin main:main`, that is, use the remote main ref to update the local main ref, it is not allowed since HEAD is currently pointing at the local main ref. You can however update other refs that the HEAD pointer is not pointing at. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git pull`: This is actually a combination of two commands: `git fetch` and then `git merge`. As such, this command WILL change things in your local repository while `git fetch` will only update the refs and any objects needed but will not change your local repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git ls-files`: This shows information about the files in the git index and the working tree. `git ls-files --stage` will show information about the files currently staged. This is useful during a `git merge`. `git ls-files -u` shows the unmerged files.  "

    "## GIT TERMINOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "**git index**: This is basically the staging area of git. This is a data structure used to hold all the information that will be committed. In other words, this is the data structure that contains what files git thinks will be part of a new commit. The information in here can be different than what is actually in your working directory or what is listed in the commit that HEAD points to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**working tree / working directory**: This is used to refer to the entire project directory of the repo. So it is the basically the directory of your project and all the directories and files inside since a project is just a giant tree structure with different files and directories branching off the root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**git snapshot**: git stores information as a 'snapshot'. So for a repo, the snapshot consists of all the files in the repo along with the current state of those files. So when git loads a snapshot, it will load all the files listed in the snapshot (also removing any files not present in the snapshot) into the repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "**git repo**: A directory that has a .git folder inside of it so that git knows how to manage the files. \n",
    "\n",
    "**git command structure**: git commands follow the general structure of `git command --options path`. Command refers to the name of the command and options are the optional actions a command can perform. Options always come after the command and have either `-` or `--` before the option name; you can have multiple options for a single command. Path is either the path to a directory or a file that the command should act on. Git documentation usually specifies option in brackets `[]` and directories in angled brackets `<>`. So a command such as `git rm --cached myfile.txt` will be presented in documentation as `git rm [--cached] <directory>`. Some options require a directory as an argument and the documentation will list it as `[--option=<directory>]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repository**: The basic container for the project, usually in the form of a directory. Git will track any changes to the directory. It will not track changes made to the parent directory. When creating a repository it is automatically set as the master branch. To set a current directory as a repository (aka create a repository), use `git init`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Origin**: A commonly accepted term used to indicate the \"original\" repository, aka the very first repository. You can refer to a local origin or a remote origin. Local origin is the original repository on the local machine. Remote origin is the repository that you cloned from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commits**: Basically a save-point of the files inside a repository. When making a commit, you save the current status of all the files. Making multiple commits builds up a commit history like a sequence of events. There are three stages to making a commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`<rev>`**: A `<rev>` in the git documentation refers to the name of a commit object or possibly a tree object. This could either be the alias of a git object like `main` or the full SHA-1 hash. You can add additional characters to the `<rev>` value such as ^ or ~ to indicate other revs relative to the specified rev. For example `<rev>~2` will indicate a rev that is the 2nd generation ancestor or grand-parent of the specified `<rev>`. So if we have a branch called `b1`, then `b1~2` indicates the grand-parent commit of the latest commit on the branch. [More information found online](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**`<refname>`**: The alias for a ref, so something like a branch name like `main` or `branch1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`<tree-ish>`**: This refers to a rev such that if you follow the chain of pointers starting from rev, it will eventually wind up pointing to a tree object. So a `tree-ish` rev is any object, commit or tree, that ultimately down the line ends up pointing to a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`<commit-ish>`**: Like the tree-ish example, this is something that ultimately ends up point to a commit object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colon or :** = This is typically used to separate a `<rev>` from the path that is used to navigate relative to that rev or within that rev. So `<tree-ish>:path` in the documentation means that we specify a tree-ish rev, which will end up pointing a tree object, and the `path` part refers to the path used to navigate through the tree contained within the tree object. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`<refspec>`**: A refspec is a mapping from a source to a target (destination). It has syntax of `<src>:<target>`. So if one wanted to `git push` the local master branch to the remote master branch, we could use: `git push origin master:master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a refspec is as follows: `[optional +]<src>:<dst>`\n",
    "\n",
    "`<src>` = a matching pattern for finding refs. For example, `refs/heads/*` will grab all refs in the directory `refs/heads` from the source, which can either be the remote server or another directory on your local machine. Here we are using the wildcard * for globbing all refs. \n",
    "\n",
    "`<dst>` = a matching pattern for the target/destination. So `refs/remotes/origin/*` will update all refs in the target/destionation directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[optional +]` = An optional `+` sign in front of `<src>:<dst>`. This tells git to update the ref even if it isn't a fast-forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, something like `git push origin b1:b5` will find the ref file for the branch named `b1` and push it to update the `b5` ref file, or `b5` branch, on the remote server. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`<pathspec>`**: Similar to the refspec, this is a matching pattern used to find certain files or configure the search so that it starts from a certain directory or place. So `docs/*.jpg` for example, is a pathspec that will grab all jpg images from the docs directory. Meanwhile, `:(top)*.js` tells git to start matching for javascript files from the root of the repository rather than the current working directory. So this will find **all** javascript files in your repository. More information can be [found here](https://css-tricks.com/git-pathspecs-and-how-to-use-them/)"

    "1. Save the file normally without involving git.\n",

    "  * `git status` = get info about what files are currently staged\n",
    "  * `git add [filename]` = add the file to the staging area\n",

Be specific in the message about the commit. When this command is executed, it will print to console the number of lines deleted. This doesn't mean any code was actually deleted. It just detects changes as though you deleted the code and then added it back.\n",

    "## GIT OBJECTS AND HOW GIT STORES INFORMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is just a giant key-value data store modeled as a linked-list. When something is inserted into a git repo, git returns a unique key that is used to retrieve the stored item. These keys are also used as the pointers within git's linked list structure. Git stores these items as \"objects\". There are different types of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * commit = store information about the commit\n",
    "  * tree = store information about a directory\n",
    "  * blob = file content stored as raw binary data; blob is short for 'binary large object'\n",
    "  * annotated tag = store tag information\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object has a unique hash to identify it, made using SHA-1 (secure hash algorithm). The hash is generated using the contents of the object. So for a source code file, it literally uses the source code itself to generate a hash. This pretty much guarantees every object has a unique hash. For tree objects, which refer to directories, it uses the structure of the directory to calculate the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hashes are used as the \"keys\" to an \"object\" in the linked-list structure. They are also used as pointers to point to other objects. So the hash of a commit is used as a pointer to point to that commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now git organizes the object types in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "commit\n",
    "  |-- tree\n",
    "        |-- blob\n",
    "        |-- blob\n",
    "        |-- tree\n",
    "              |-- blob\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The commit object has a hash that points to a tree object. That tree object has 3 hashes: 2 for blobs, 1 for another tree. That second tree object contains a hash for another blob object. Therefore, git simply stores everything in a giant graph structure. You can view the objects it currently stores in the .git/objects directory. The objects folder will list a bunch of folders, with each folder name only being 2 characters long. Specifically, when git generates a hash for an object, the hash will be 40 characters long. It will take the first 2 characters and use that as the name of the folder and store the remaining 38 characters as a file in that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk more about how git generates hashes for objects. For blob objects, it prefixes the object content with the word \"blob\" followed by the object content's length in regular numerical numbers followed by a null character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree hashes are different. Trees objects contain one line per file or subdirectory/subtree with each line having the following format:\n",
    "`file-permission object-type object-hash file-name`\n",
    "Example is: `100644 blob e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 index.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "File permission here is 644 (ignoring the 100), and permissions of 644 mean that owner has read/write access of the file while others can only read. Permissions of 600 mean owner can read/write but other people can't do anything. To generate the tree hash, it uses all this information to feed into the SHA-1 algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for commits, their hashes are generated using the information contained in them:\n",
    "  * parent commit hash, so each new commit points to the previous one. May or may not be present depending on commit history.\n",

Instead of using the hash to explicitly specify the commit we move to, we can do a relative move: `git reset current~<num>`. So `git reset current~2` means to move back 2 commits relative to the current commit we are currently on. So in the above example, if we were on commit4 in the new branch, then `git reset current~2` moves us back to commit2. `git reset current^1` is used to move back a commit by picking a specific parent commit. Since a commit can have multiple parents, you have to pick one of them based on their parent-number. So `git reset current^1` means move back one commit towards the parent with parent-number = 1. Similarly, `git reset current^1~2` does the same but moves back two commits towards the parent with parent-number = 1. \n",

Normally, the HEAD pointer points to the head of a branch (which in turns points to the last commit in the branch) but by using `git checkout <commit>`, you can force it to point to a specific commit. This means it no longer neccessarily points to the latest commit in a branch. To get back to a non-detached HEAD state, simply checkout a branch. So `git checkout <branch>` will simply move the HEAD pointer back to the ref (pointer) that points to the last commit in the branch you checkout. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the detached HEAD state, you are allowed to make changes and make new commits. These new commits will be based off of the commit you originally checked out with the HEAD in the detached state. These commits are not immediately added to your git history and tree. That means these commits are in a sort of limbo state in which they can disappear when no ref points to them. If the commits you make in the detached HEAD state are not needed anymore, simply checkout another branch to move the HEAD pointer somewhere else. Now this pseudo-branch will eventually be garbage collected since no ref or pointer points to the last commit of the branch. If you want to keep the changes you made in this experimental branch, then create a new branch with `git branch <branch-name>`. This will create a new branch head pointer that points to the last commit in the experimental branch and move the HEAD pointer to point at the new branch head pointer. \n",

One is the `main` pointer for your local repository, while the other is `origin/main` which is used to point to the commit that the `main` pointer on the remote server is pointing to. This `origin/main` pointer is a remote tracking branch as it tracks and follows the movement of the `main` pointer on the remote repo. You cannot manually edit or move the position of the `origin/main` pointer. \n",

It serves as the space between the actual files on your working directory (the project folder/repository you actually see on your computer) and what is listed in your commit history.

When you run `git checkout`, then git goes to the commit history, locates the files associated with the commit, and then populates your working directory and the index with the files from the commit. So it looks like the index has two sections to it: one for the files to be committed, and one section for the files in the current working directory. \n",

So only the HEAD pointer has changed but the files listed in the git index and the working directory are still the same and match up. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second step is to update the git index with the files listed in the commit that the HEAD is pointing to now. This is the default behavior of `git reset`. Calling `git reset --mixed` with the `--mixed` option has the exact same behavior. This means that the git index has been reset to the new commit.

Then this will only copy the listed files from the previous commit to the git index. The HEAD and working tree will stay the same. \n",

    "3. The third step is optional and only runs if you call `git reset --hard`. Then git will use the files located in the git index to update the working directory. This involves actually deleting/adding files to your working directory. Note that the deletion is only permanent if the changes to the file were not committed. So if you committed the changes, then you can undo the delete by moving back to the original commit to restore the files as the state of the files are contained in that commit. But if you did not, then you would lose the uncommitted changes as there would be no previous commit to recover the information. \n",

So if you are merging a branch called 'b1' into the main branch, and you want to accept all the changes of the b1 branch over the main branch, you can use `git checkout --theirs b1`.

One of the ways of picking out which files you want to keep without going into the file itself is to use `git checkout` with either the `--ours` or `--theirs` option like before but with a `<pathspec>` provided for the specific file. So `git checkout --ours <pathspec>` will overwrite the current working tree with whatever is currently listed in the git index that corresponds to the current branch's version. It won't move the branch ref or HEAD.

Some files may have only one piece of information and some may have multiple pieces. So one file can have one piece of information listed in stage number 0, but another may have two pieces of information listed at stage numbers 1 and 2. In normal circumstances, only stage number 0 is filled with information which indicates that the version of the path or file is good. In a merge conflict, the other stage number attributes are populated:\n",

    "When you pick out the correct version of the file you want and run `git add` to include that file in the git index, then git will fill stage number 0 with the information about the version you just added and remove any entries in the other stage numbers. Files that only have stage number 0 populated mean they will be part of the next commit. If you remove a file from the staging area, then git will remove information listed in all the stage numbers; then that file will be considered to not be part of the next commit since it is no longer listed in the git index. A merge conflict is resolved when each of the files in the git index only have information listed in stage number 0, and the other stage numbers are empty. \n",

    "When you call `git checkout --ours <pathspec>`, then git will simply copy the entry listed in stage number 2 and use it to update the working tree to that version. Something similar happens with the `--theirs` option. Then when you run `git add`, that version you just updated is then put into stage number 0 and the rest of the stage numbers are cleared. \n",

    "### UNDOING A GIT MERGE\n",
    "\n",
    "You can undo a `git merge` in several ways. One way is via a `git reset --hard` call. Say you had branch b1 merge into branch b2. Now to undo the merge, which resulted in a merge commit that points to the previous two branches you can reset the branch head of branch b2. So first check out branch b2, then call `git reset --hard HEAD~`. This will move the b2 branch head back one commit, along with the HEAD pointer, update the git index and update the working tree. Then the merge commit will be left over as an unused commit that will be eventually garbage collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another is to use `git revert`. This command creates a new commit whose contents matches a previous commit. The merge commit will still be in the commit history but will effectively be 'overwritten' by this new commit. When a merge commit happens, the commit will remember the parents in the merge and order them. The 'mainline' parent has parent-number = 1, and the second parent = 2. So merging a branch called b1 into main will have: main = 1, b1 = 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the command `git revert -m 1 HEAD` will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the commit pointed to by HEAD. In this case the commit should be a merge commit otherwise the `-m 1` option doesn't make sense as there may only be one parent. \n",
    "2. Then look at the parent with parent-number = 1, then grab the previous commit from that parent. \n",
    "3. Copy that commit into a new commit\n",
    "4. Attach the commit as part of the commit history, and then update the git index, working tree, HEAD to this new commit.\n",

    "### MERGE STRATEGIES\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes merging is tedious due to a large number of conflicts that can arise from the merge. As a result, when calling `git merge <branch>`, you can pick a specific strategy for git to adopt when picking what files/changes to keep and what to discard in the new merge commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you make a change to a couple of files in a certain branch and want to incorporate them into another branch but you only want those specific files and not a snapshot of the entire working tree. In that case you perform a sort of pseduo-merge in which you update the git index with the specific files from the other branch and then make a commit. For example, let's say you want to incorporate the changes from branch b1 into the main branch but only for a couple of files. You can first switch to the main branch and then run `git checkout b1 <pathspec-to-file1-in-b1-branch> ...` This will update the git index with those files only. Then you can make a commit on the main branch to add on those changes. Note that this is not a true merge as the b2 branch remains separate from the main branch and no merge commit has been made. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also try another strategy which is to update the side branch up to the one you want to merge into. So if there is a side branch b1 and a main branch in which the main branch has moved up ahead of the b1 branch. You want to incorporate some changes in the b1 branch into the main branch but keep everything else in the main branch the same. You can try updating the b1 branch to be same as the main branch but keep the b1 changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Checkout the side branch (b1) \n",
    "2. The git index, working tree, and head are now updated to the b1 branch\n",
    "3. Run `git reset <commit-on-main-branch>` This will update the HEAD and the index to be on the main branch commit but working tree is the same\n",
    "4. Restore any changes in the index. Now the index and working tree are different. Some of the files in the index may or may not be in the working tree. You need to discard the deleted changes to the working tree that do not apply to the files you want to add. git currently thinks that the state of the current working tree are the 'new' changes and the index is old. In this case, it is the other way around and you want to discard the changes to the working directory and keep the index for the files you are not trying to add. So basically discard all changes to files you did not modify in the side branch.\n",
    "5. Add the specific files you want to merge into the main branch\n",
    "6. Make a commit to commit the files. \n",
    "7. The side branch will now be added as a fast-forwarded commit to the main branch but you will lose the previous side branch. Specifically, the side branch ref will now point to the commit just made which in turn will point to the main branch ref commit. So it will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "            sidebranch\n",
    "              |\n",
    "commit <- newcommit\n",
    "   |\n",
    "  main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the commit that the side branch ref was originally pointing to will not show up in the commit history anymore for the side branch. The reason for this is that the `git reset <commit>` moves both the branch ref and HEAD pointer to the specified commit. So any additional commits will be based off of this branch and not others. At this point, it was probably easier to just do a regular merge and resolve the conflicts more formally. "
