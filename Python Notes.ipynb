If you want to use one specific convention over the other, you can instead import `posixpath` or `ntpath` which will provide the same interface as the `os.path` moodule. So you can use `import posixpath` to use the posix style path convention on a Windows machine if you want. \n",

So on a posix system, `a//b` and `a/b/` and `a/./b` and `a/foo/../b` become `a/b` since the extra slashes or up-level references are redundant.

Another way to run it is to use the `asyncio.run(func())` function of the module. \n",
